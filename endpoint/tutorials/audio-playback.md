## WAV Files

Simple audio playback is accomplished by reading a PCM WAV file and passing the data to the built-in analog out pin. Even easier, parse the WAV file on a PC and include the PCM samples.

A WAV file parser driver is provided under the [Codec](../drivers/codec.md) drives page.

## MP3 Files

MP3 file decoding can be accomplished by using one of the many MP3 decoders available from VLSI Solution http://www.vlsi.fi/. A driver is already provide, see the [Codec](../drivers/codec.md) drives page.
