# Multithreading
---
TinyCLR OS is a single process system, only running your application. This is in fact a good security feature! However, TinyCLR OS supports threading similar to full .NET.

```cs
void Blinker() {
    // LED on
    Thread.Sleep(100);
    // LED off
    Thread.Sleep(100);
}

var t = new Thread(Blinker);
t.Start();
// do secondary task
Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite);
```
