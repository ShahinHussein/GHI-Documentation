# TLS
---

TLS (Transport Layer Security) is how the Internet securely works, for banks, airports and security systems. TinyCLR OS supports TLS 1.2, a global security standard. All encryption, decryption and certification are done in secure internal memory to keep sensitive data safe.

TinyCLR OS can be set up using TLS as a [Client](tls-client.md) or [Server](tls-server.md).
