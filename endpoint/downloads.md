## Endpoint Libraries

Endpoint Libraries are designed to fill in any gaps the .NET API is missing for hardware. It is preferred to access these libraries through NuGet.org by using the IDE's default package source.

> [!Note]
> Make sure to check the `Include prerelease` box in Visual Studio's NuGet package manager if you're not using the production release.

The libraries are provided here in case you're having trouble with the online source or need an older library that's not hosted on NuGet.
